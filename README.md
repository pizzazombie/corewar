# corewar is 21 school project to create a corewar (virtual machine), asm (assembler), dis_asm (disassembler) and champion (fighting program).
<br>
A champion is written in assembly syntax. A champion is compiled by the asm (assembler), into a binary file. The compiled champion is then loaded into corewar (virtual machine) as a process, with other champions; and their bytecode is loaded into virtual circular memory.
